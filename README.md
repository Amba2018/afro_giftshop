# Afro Giftshop
[Afro Giftshop](https://afro-giftshop-4485fce00cde.herokuapp.com/) is a project created in order for small tourism businesses to easily keep track of their Giftshop sales, day batch and inventory. It will allow them to keep track of souvenirs sold as well as update them.
It is customisable and editable to allow the user to change their shop batch and inventory items through multiple options.
