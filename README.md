# User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)  

## User Goals
Afro Giftshop is designed like a 'digital notebook', interactive, safe way for tourism agency to keep track of their mini shop data. 
The data will be viewable via the CLI (Command Line Interface) but stored in a connected, secure, Google worksheet which is not directly accessible to the user. 
Some key user goals for this project have been:

* It must be easy to navigate, with clear Menu options.
* An attractive, bright user interface to engage the user.
* Clear instructions are made available for correct data input.
* The option to clear data if needed.
* Data must be completely editable.
